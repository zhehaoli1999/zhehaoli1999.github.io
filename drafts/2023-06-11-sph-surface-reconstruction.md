title:  "Reconstructing Surfaces of Particle-Based Fluids Using Anisotropic Kernels"
--- 

The paper "Reconstructing Surfaces of Particle-Based Fluids Using Anisotropic Kernels" is a classic and widely-used reconstruction method for particle-based fluid simulation. In this post, I will show you how to reproduce it. 

### 1. Algorithm
