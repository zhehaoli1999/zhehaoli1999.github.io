As the deadline for SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 has already passed for two weeks, I feel the need for some valuable summaries and first-handed reflections. Here are some of them.  

1. **20/80 Principle**
Always leave some time everyday to think what is the most important part of the project. It may be the comments of reviewers, or the experiments that related the closest with your core contributions. 
Sometimes the minor parts or the attempt to improve a submodule may look really fun, but never bury yourself in the minor parts or minor contributions too long. 

2. **Start From the Easiest Way**
Always remember to try the easiest way to solve a problem first. Never solve a problem with the hardest method first, even it may be luring that it looks really good in the paper.  

3. **Take Quick Action** 
Sometimes an idea need to be quickly implemented. 

4. **Keep Your Machine Busy**
Never miss a night and keep your machine running when you are sleeping.  

5. **Push Your Advisor & Teammates**

6. **Visual Aesthetics Always Matters**
Rendering quality always matters. When it looks good, it is good.
