<!--Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:-->

<!--`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`-->

<!--Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.-->

<!--Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:-->

<!--{% highlight ruby %}-->
<!--def print_hi(name)-->
  <!--puts "Hi, #{name}"-->
<!--end-->
<!--print_hi('Tom')-->
<!--#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.-->
<!--{% endhighlight %}-->

<!--x = 2y -->

As AI assistance like ChatGPT becomes stronger and stronger, we are facing an age that everyone needs to learn
how to live with these AI assistance and leverage their help. It's true that these big neural networks seem to
learn to answer your questions by just reading most, if not all, information on the internet during the training, which 
usually leads to problems such as "token bias". But for me, all the clever ways proposed by AI researchers to make these neural networks figure out a way to "solidify" 
all the infomation while acchieving fast responce speed to retrive and merge the information to get a not-bad, sometimes brilliant, answer is still amazing enough.  


For me, I tried to use ChatGPT to help build this personal website, 
where my propmts are like `The detailed steps to build a personal academic website with blogs, which supports
latex formula`. Then I got some useful infomation about Jekyll, Jekyll themes, Github Pages and mathjax. After
some iterations, I finally makes my personal website work. Though it is still a little plain at look without
fancy styles, and I believe there are already AI tools to help me beautify the design of my website frontend, but now it is just enough for me to write blogs :) 


For my last thought about the future of AI assistance, I believe every complex system will need a ChatGPT-like
assistance, and this is just what is quickly happening these days in Blender, Photoshop, Windows, etc. Then one of the remaining questions will be how
to combine and communicate between these AI assistances to build a smoothly automatic pipeline for people's need, since each company and software has their own intelligence prosperities, I am suspicious whether 
there will be an one-for-all AI assistance (but this may be acchieved on opensource software first). If so, a upper-level AI may be needed then to control all the low-level AI asssitances, similar idea like "HuggingGPT".

<!--Take content generation industry for example, I'd like to develop a personal VR FPS & survival game, which is happening on a-->
<!--remote planet, where players act as refugees fleeing from a horrible war happening on their homeland. Then players-->
<!--need to settle down on the new planet to build colonies with limited resources, collabrate or fight with native creatures, investigate the-->
<!--new planet, and finally to figure out a way to return their homeland, where an astounding secret may be then uncovered.-->
<!--For the storyline of the game, I'd like to generate the plots with ChatGPT. Then, I need to design main characters-->
<!--(with their 3D models, equipment assets, voices, background settings, etc.) and enemies on the new planet using 3D modeling tools like Blender. -->
<!--Then I generate some animation cutscenes with some other tools. Finally (?) I build the code for core gameplay functionalities based on mature gameplay assets.-->
<!--Just by imagining this workflow, it is excited to see there are quite a lot of parts AI can assist us. -->
